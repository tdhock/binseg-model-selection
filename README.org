selection with binary segmentation, to support R package

[[file:figure-neuroblastoma.R]] makes the figure below, which shows a real
data set for which there are differences between binsegRcpp and
ruptures/changepoint.

[[file:figure-timings-data.R]] makes [[file:figure-timings-data.csv]]

[[file:figure-timings.R]] reads that and makes

Figure above was created using synthetic data which achieve the
best/worst case time complexity of the binary segmentation
algorithm. For each data set of a given size N in
{2^2=4,8,16,32,...,2^20=1,048,576}, we run binary segmentation up to a
max of N/2 segments (and not going to a larger N if the algo/case
resulted in a time greater than 100 seconds). The timings suggest that
changepoint R package uses a cubic algorithm (three nested for loops)
whereas binsegRcpp uses an algorithm which is log-linear in the best
case, and quadratic in the worst case. The ruptures python module
seems to be asymptotically faster than changepoint but slower than
binsegRcpp, maybe quadratic?

[[file:figure-timings-loss.png]]

Figure above shows that loss for binsegRcpp is always less than loss
for others, suggesting that there are bugs in the other
implementations.

[[file:figure-select-segments-data.R]] computes simulations using a
variety of model selection criteria, saving results to
[[file:figure-select-segments-data.csv]]

[[file:figure-select-segments.R]] reads that result CSV file and makes
