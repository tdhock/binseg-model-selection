Figure above was created using synthetic data which achieve the
best/worst case time complexity of the binary segmentation
algorithm. For each data set of a given size N in {8,16,32,...,16384},
we run binary segmentation up to a max of N/2 segments. The timings
suggest that changepoint R package uses a cubic algorithm (three
nested for loops) whereas binsegRcpp uses an algorithm which is
log-linear in the best case, and quadratic in the worst case. The
ruptures python module seems to be asymptotically faster than
changepoint but slower than binsegRcpp, maybe quadratic?

Figure above shows that loss for binsegRcpp is always less than loss
for others, suggesting that there are bugs in the other
implementations.

[[file:figure-select-segments-data.R]] computes simulations using a
variety of model selection criteria, saving results to
[[file:figure-select-segments-data.csv]]

[[file:figure-select-segments.R]] reads that result CSV file and makes
