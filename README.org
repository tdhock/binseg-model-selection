Experiments to support upcoming research paper about methods for model
selection with binary segmentation, to support R package

Figure above was created using synthetic data which achieve the
best/worst case time complexity of the binary segmentation
algorithm. For each data set of a given size N in {8,16,32,...,16384},
we run binary segmentation up to a max of N/2 segments. The timings
suggest that changepoint R package uses a cubic algorithm (three
nested for loops) whereas binsegRcpp uses an algorithm which is
log-linear in the best case, and quadratic in the worst case.

[[file:figure-select-segments-data.R]] computes simulations using a
variety of model selection criteria, saving results to
[[file:figure-select-segments-data.csv]]

[[file:figure-select-segments.R]] reads that result CSV file and makes
